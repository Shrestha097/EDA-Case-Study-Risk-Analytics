## Analysis Approach
Following steps have been used to analyze the dataset :
- Imported the required libraries.
- Read the two datasets using pandas data frame.
- Gained understanding the of the data using functions like describe, info, shape etc.
- Figured out if there are any null values or missing values in the dataset.
- Cleaned the data by either removing or imputing the missing values
- Found the outliers or incorrect data present in the dataset
- Treated all the outliers and incorrect values
- Merged the two datasets using the common column in them
- Calculated the imbalance percentage in the data using TARGET variable
- Divided the dataset into 2 dataframes with TARGET 0 and 1.
- Found inferences in the data by using different data visualizations technique
